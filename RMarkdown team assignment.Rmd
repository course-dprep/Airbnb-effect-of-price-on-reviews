## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

download.file('http://data.insideairbnb.com/the-netherlands/north-holland/amsterdam/2023-09-03/visualisations/listings.csv',"appartments.csv")
library(tidyverse)

view('appartments.csv')

# Assuming you have a data frame named 'listings' with columns: price, reviews, and date.

# Sort by price in ascending order
sorted_listings <- appartments[order(appartments$price), ]

# Select the top 100 and bottom 100 listings
top_100 <- sorted_listings[1:100, ]
bottom_100 <- sorted_listings[(nrow(sorted_listings) - 99):nrow(sorted_listings), ]

# Calculate the total number of reviews for each subset
total_reviews_top <- sum(top_100$number_of_reviews)
total_reviews_bottom <- sum(bottom_100$number_of_reviews)

# Compare the total number of reviews
if (total_reviews_top > total_reviews_bottom) {
  cat("Top 100 listings have more reviews than bottom 100 listings.")
} else if (total_reviews_top < total_reviews_bottom) {
  cat("Bottom 100 listings have more reviews than top 100 listings.")
} else {
  cat("Top 100 and bottom 100 listings have the same number of reviews.")
}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
