# Project description
Leaving a review and sharing it with the world wide web is only a matter of seconds. The rise of the internet gave room for leaving reviews about anything, anywhere, very easily. Whereas a few decades a go people relied more on word of mouth and written reviews in papers, nowadays we have access to millions of reviews in just a few mouse clicks.

We are curious whether the amount of reviews is higher for the top 100 most expensive single room compared to the bottom top 100 least expensive single rooms. The reasoning is that people who book expensive rooms want to know that their rooms is from high quality and thus higher value lots of reviews. However, people who stay at budget Airbnb's are maybe more critical of booking a place with more reviews. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the amount of reviews of single rooms on the most expensive and least expensive Airbnb's we will conduct a research. We will atempt to answer the following question:

__"To what extent do the top 100 most expensive single rooms get more reviews than the bottom top 100 of single rooms compared across 5 Western-European capitals (Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, London, Paris) on a quarterly time base? An analysis of multiple cities and time-frames."__

# Analysis
The importance of considering the pricing on reviews is to gain a better understanding of the relationship between reviews and pricing of housing. The research method chosen is ....

In this research, we have selected 5 capitals from western European countries. The reason for this is that those cities are most likely to have similar circumstances and thus will provide a solid background to research the question. The five selected cities are:
* Amsterdam
* Berlin
* Brussels
* London
* Paris

Two data points are used. The data is recent data from 2022 & 2023 and from two different seasons: summer and winter. The data used is semi-annual based data:
* June 2023
* December 2022
